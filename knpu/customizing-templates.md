# Customize all the Templates!

We can do *a lot* via config... but eventually... we're going to need to *really*
dig in. And that will probably mean overriding the templates used by the bundle.

## Exploring the Templates

First, let's go look at those templates! Open `vendor/javiereguiluz/easyadmin-bundle/Resources/views/default`.
Ah, ha! These are the *many* templates used to render every single part of our admin.
We can override *any* of these. But even better! We can override any of these for
specific entities: using different customized templates for different sections. Or
even... different templates to control how individual *fields* render.

Check out `layout.html.twig`... this is the full admin page layout. It's awesome
because it's *filled* with blocks. So instead of *completely* replacing the layout,
you could extend this and override only the blocks you need. We won't do that for the
layout, but we will for `list.html.twig`.

This is responsible for the `list` view we've been working on. And not surprisingly,
there are also new, show and edit templates.

But *most* of the templates start with `field_`... interesting. Remember how each
field on the list page has a "data type"? We saw this in the EasyAdminBundle configuration.
The "data type" is used to determine which template should render the data in that
column. `firstDiscoveredAt` is a `date` type... and hey! It has a `template`
option that defaults to `field_date.html.twig`. And by opening that template, you
can see how the `date` type is rendered.

## How to Override Templates

Ok, let's *finally* override some stuff! How!? On the same
[List, Search and Show Views Configuration][list_search_show_configuration]
page, near the bottom, you'll see an "Advanced Design Configuration" section.
There are a *bunch* of different ways to override a template... ah... too many options!
Let's simplify: (A) you can override a template via configuration - which are options
1 and 2 - or (B) by putting a file in an `easy_admin` directory - options 3 and 4.
We'll try both.

Ok, first challenge! I want to override the way the `id` field is rendered for
`Genus`: add a little `key` icon next to the number... ya know, because it's the
primary key.

This means we need to override the `field_id.html.twig` template, because `id` is
actually a data type. Copy `field_id.html.twig`. Then, in `app/Resources/views`,
I already have an `admin` directory. So inside that, create a new `fields` directory
and paste the file there, as `_id.html.twig`. Now, add the icon: `fa fa-key`:

[[[ code('833c650c07') ]]]

Cool! I put the file here... just because I already have an `admin` directory.
But EasyAdminBundle doesn't automagically know it's there. Nope, we need to tell
it. In `config.yml`, to use this *only* for `Genus`, add a `templates` key, then
`field_id` - the name of the original template - set to `admin/fields/_id.html.twig`:

[[[ code('1fe8733631') ]]]

Try that! Yes! It *is* using our template... and only in the `Genus` section.
But this key thing is pretty excellent, so we should use it everywhere. Copy
the templates config and comment it out:

[[[ code('1302869503') ]]]

Just like with almost anything, we can also control the template globally: paste
this under `design`:

[[[ code('5995038e0f') ]]]

Now the key icon shows up *everywhere*.

Next, I want to override something bigger: the entire list template. And we'll
use a different convention to do that.
